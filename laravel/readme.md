### Applying the Route Middleware

Included route middleware let you authorize by either a role or permission:

```php
Route::group(['middleware' => 'access.routeNeedsPermission:view-backend', function()
{
    Route::group(['prefix' => 'access'], function ()
    	{
    		/*User Management*/
    		Route::resource('users', 'Backend\Access\UserController');
    	});
});
```

The following middleware ships with the boilerplate:

- access.routeNeedsRole
- access.routeNeedsPermission

<a name="creating_middleware"/>
### Create Your Own Middleware

If you would like to create your own middleware, the following methods are available.

**Note: A helper method ```access()``` is also available. E.g. access()->hasRole('Administrator') which resolves the Access facade out of the IoC container. You can modify this function to add more functionality in ```app/helpers.php```.**

```php
/**
	 * Checks if the user has a Role by its name.
	 * @param string $name
	 * @return bool
*/
Access::hasRole($role);

/**
	 * Checks to see if the user has an array of roles, and whether or not all must return true to authenticate
	 * @param array $roles
	 * @param boolean $needsAll
	 * @return bool
*/
Access::hasRoles($roles, $needsAll);

/**
	 * Check if user has a permission by its name.
	 * This also has a wrapper function called hasPermission which takes the same arguments
	 * @param string $permission.
	 * @return bool
*/
Access::can($permission);

/**
	 * Check an array of permissions and whether or not all are required to continue
	 * This also has a wrapper function called hasPermissions which takes the same arguments
	 * @param array $permissions
	 * @param boolean $needsAll
	 * @return bool
*/
Access::canMultiple($permissions, $needsAll);
```
**Access::** by default uses the currently authenticated user. You can also do:

```php
$user->hasRole($role);
$user->hasRoles($roles, $needsAll);
$user->can($permission);
$user->canMultiple($permissions, $needsAll);
$user->hasPermission($permission); //Wrapper function for can()
$user->hasPermissions($permissions, $needsAll); //Wrapper function for canMultiple()
```

<a name="blade_extensions"/>
### Blade Extensions

Access comes with @blade extensions to help you show and hide data by role or permission without clogging up your code with unwanted if statements:

### @role

Accepts a single Role Name or ID

```php
@role('User')
    This content will only show if the authenticated user has the `User` role.
@endauth

@role(1)
    This content will only show if the authenticated user has the role with an ID of `1`.
@endauth
```

### @roles

Accepts an array of Role Names or IDs

```php
@roles(['Administrator', 'User'])
    This content will only show if the authenticated user has the `Administrator` role OR the `User` role.
@endauth

@roles([1, 2])
    This content will only show if the authenticated user has the role with ID of `1` OR `2`.
@endauth
```

### @needsroles

Accepts an array of roles or role IDs and only returns true if the user has all roles provided.

```php
@needsroles(['Administrator', 'User'])
    This content will only show if the authenticated user has BOTH the `Administrator` role AND the `User` role.
@endauth

@needsroles([1, 2])
    This content will only show if the authenticated user has BOTH roles with ID's of `1` AND `2`.
@endauth
```

### @permission

Accepts a single Permission Name or ID

```php
@permission('view-backend')
    This content will only show if the authenticated user has the `view-backend` permission.
@endauth

@permission(1)
    This content will only show if the authenticated user permission with an ID of `1`.
@endauth
```

### @permissions

Accepts an array of Permission Names or IDs

```php
@permissions(['view-backend', 'view-some-content'])
    This content will only show if the authenticated user has the `view-backend` permission OR the `view-some-content` permission.
@endauth

@permissions([1, 2])
    This content will only show if the authenticated user has the permission with ID of `1` OR `2`.
@endauth
```

### @needspermissions

Accepts an array of permissions or permission IDs and only returns true if the user has all permissions provided.

```php
@needspermissions(['view-backend', 'view-some-content'])
    This content will only show if the authenticated user has BOTH the `view-backend` permission AND the `view-some-content` permission.
@endauth

@needspermissions([1, 2])
    This content will only show if the authenticated user has BOTH permissions with ID's of `1` AND `2`.
@endauth
```

**Note: You can also use @else for an if/else statement.**

If you want to show or hide a specific section you can do so in your layout files the same way:

```php
@role('User')
    @section('special_content')
@endauth

@permission('can_view_this_content')
    @section('special_content')
@endauth
```


You can add more extensions by appending to App\Providers\AccessServiceProvider@registerBladeExtensions

<a name="permission-dependencies"/>
## Permission Dependencies

The permission dependencies section allows you to tell the system that one permission is dependent on one or more permissions.

For example: If the user has the create-user permission, than they also need the view-backend and view-access-management permissions. Otherwise they will never be able to get to the create user screen. So create-user is dependent on view-backend and view-access-management.

You can specify which permissions are dependent on others in each permissions dependency section.

## Socialite

To configure socialite, add your credentials to your .env file. The redirects must follow the convention ```http://mysite.com/auth/login/SERVICE```. Available services are ```github```, ```facebook```, ```twitter```, and ```google```. Links to each are included in ```login.blade.php```.

If you are getting a ```cURL error 60``` on localhost, follow [these directions](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28635295/laravel-socialite-testing-on-localhost-ssl-certificate-issue).

<a name="javascript-notes"/>
## PHP to Javascript Transformer

The Laracast PHP to Javascript Transformer is included in this project.
The config file is published as ```config/javascript.php```

By default the javascript variables are binded to frontend.layouts.master view file, so you can bind javascript to any method in any frontend controller.

If you need binding available in both frontend and backend controllers you should make a super master layout, and use the frontend/backend master layouts as children. After that you can specify that layout in the ```javascript.bind_js_vars_to_this_view``` config option.

A ```javascript()``` helper has been added globally so you do not have to include any files in your controllers, you may just do:

```
javascript()->put([
	'test' => 'it works!'
]);
```

There is an example in ```FrontendController@index``` and is printed out in ```frontend.index```
    
## Troubleshooting

If for any reason something goes wrong, try each of the following:

Delete the `composer.lock` file

Run the `dumpautoload` command

       $ composer dumpautoload -o
       
If the above fails to fix, and the command line is referencing errors in `compiled.php`, do the following:
       
Delete the `storage/framework/compiled.php` file
       
**If all of the above don't work please [report here](https://github.com/rappasoft/Laravel-5-Boilerplate/issues).**
