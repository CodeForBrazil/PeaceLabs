# PeaceLabs
This space is design to co-create PeaceLabs.co, platform that uses collaboration technologies, such as crowdsourcing and crowdfunding, to improve the chances of success of social, environmental and economic community projects.

After several social projects developed, crowdfunded & executed over 2014 #CheerForPeace, a startup social enterprise, learned that crowdfunding successfully is a very difficult task & that this is especially true for social projects.

So to solve this problem, in its latest iteration, the startup is now launching a new product called PeaceLabs, a platform for Peace Ambassadors to co-create projects in the sustainability & social responsibility arena with collaboration technologies for crowdsourcing the community's input while helping improve the success rate of crowdfunding "Peace Projects."
